Internship Assignment – JavaScript (var, let, const)
Topic: JavaScript Variables (var, let, const) Submission Date: Tomorrow Instructions:
•	Answer all questions clearly
•	Mention reason for error-based questions
•	Write clean and readable code

SECTION A: Technical Questions


1.	What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Ans: 
Keyword	Scope	Redeclaration	Reassignment	Hoisting
var	Function-scoped	 Allowed	Allowed	 Hoisted (initialized as undefined)
let	Block-scoped	 Not allowed	Allowed	 Hoisted (but in Temporal Dead Zone)
const	Block-scoped	 Not allowed	 Not allowed	 Hoisted (but in Temporal Dead Zone)


2.	Which keyword allows redeclaration and why?
Ans: Var allows redeclaration. Because this was part of the original design of JavaScript. It treats multiple declarations of the same variable name in the same scope as a single variable, simply overwriting the previous value. This often leads to accidental bugs in large scripts.


3.	Which keyword allows reinitialization?
Ans: Both var and let allow you to change the value of a variable after it has been created.


4.	Which keyword does not allow redeclaration and reinitialization?
Ans: Const allows the redeclaration and reinitialization. Because once declared and initialized, we cannot redeclare or reassign it.


5.	Why should const be used for fixed values?
Ans: Because const prevents accidental changes to a variable’s value, making code more stable and predictable. It is best for values that should never change, like configuration data or constants.


6.	What error occurs when redeclaring a let variable?
Ans: We will receive a SyntaxError.
         Because Let will not allow redeclaring.


7.	What error occurs when reassigning a const variable?
Ans: We will receive a TypeError.
         Because Const will not allow reassigning.


8.	Which keyword is preferred in modern JavaScript and why?
Ans: Both Let and Const are preferred in modern JavaScript. Because they provide block scope, prevent accidental redeclaration, and make code more predictable.


9.	Can const be declared without initialization? Explain.
Ans:  No, because A const variable must be initialized at the time of declaration, otherwise a SyntaxError occurs.


10.	When should var be avoided?
Ans: var should be avoided in modern JavaScript development due to its function-scoping behaviour and hoisting, which can lead to unexpected behaviour and makes the code less predictable compared to block-scoped let and const.


SECTION B: Code-Based Questions

11.	Predict the output:
var a = 10; a = 20; var a = 30; console.log(a);
Output: a=30


12.	Predict the output:
let b = 5; b = 15; console.log(b);
Output: b=15


13.	Identify the error:
let x = 10; let x = 20;
Output: SyntaxError


14.	Identify the error:
const y = 50; y = 100;
Output: TypeError


15.	Write a program using var to show redeclaration.
Ans: var user = “Siva”;
        var user = “Prasad”;
        console.log(user);
  Output: Prasad


16.	Write a program using let to show reinitialization.
Ans: let age = 23;
        let age = 28;
        console.log(age);
  Output: 28


17.	Write a program using const and explain why value cannot change.
Ans: const PI = 30;
         const PI = 40;
        console.log(PI);
 Output: TypeError
Explanation: A const value cannot be changed or redeclared. Use it for fixed constants like mathematical or configuration values.


18.	Convert var to let where applicable.
Ans: var name = “Sasi”;
              name = “Kumar”;
        console.log(name);

        let name = “Sasi’;
             name = “Kumar”;   // value can change
        console.log(name);


19.	Convert var to const where applicable.
Ans: var country = “INDIA”;
         console.log(country);

         const country = “INDIA”;
         console.log(country);


20.	Write your own example for var, let, and const.
Ans: Example using var
var score = 10;
var score = 15; // Reassign
var score = 18; // Redeclare
console.log( score); 
Output: 18

Example using let
let age = 15;
let age = 25; // Reassign allowed
      let age = 35; // Redeclare not allowed
console.log( age);
Output: 25

Example using const
const country = "INDIA";
const country = "SRI LANKA"; // Not allowed
console.log(country);
Output: INDIA
